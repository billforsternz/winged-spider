Just Starting Out
=================

Winged Spider is intended to be a innovative (I hope), spectactularly easy to use static
website builder. The idea is that Winged Spider will take as input content organised
nicely in a well named directory hierarchy, and generate as output web ready content
with the same structure. The directory and file names from the input are reflected
directly in the menu structure that is presented to the web consumer for navigation
through the web content.

Initially the leaf nodes of the structure will be either .html files or markdown files
that Winged Spider will convert to html.

So to make a website, write your pages in markdown, name them sensibly and organise
them in hierarchical folders. Then run Winged Spider with a pre-supplied or custom
template file and get a website that lets users navigate through all the content in an
intuitive way, using menus that directly reflect the structure defined by the folder
hierarchy.

The first pre-supplied template will be based on "pure", a CSS framework from Yahoo.
I've had good results with it in with manually generated pages, and look forward to
using Winged Spider to make my websites instead. Pure is not being maintained, but it
works well for simple projects and sometimes not being maintained is a feature not a
bug (because the sands aren't shifting under you, you're using something that's finished
and works).

I'm just getting started with this. The first checkin will include some code to navigate
the directory structure and some other code that builds html from content plus template.
It's just a starting point and doesn't do anything useful yet.

(The name Winged Spider means nothing - it's just a cool name, and I bought wingedspider.com
a few years back).
