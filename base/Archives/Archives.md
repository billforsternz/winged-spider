##NZCF Website Archives

This is intended to be a comprehensive archive system that will comprise old Home Pages,
Results pages, and a separate Tournament archive. A good start has been made. The home page section
is complete, with stories back to 2007 available in the fresh new NZCF website format. Old results
are available in their original format, and an increasing number of tournament crosstables are
available in the tournament pages. (Having said that progress has stalled after a decent start -
so look for some real progress again from mid 2021).
