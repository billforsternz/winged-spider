@HNew Zealand Chess History
The history page has now been broken up into a subtopics that can be accessed from the menu. Many thanks to Michael Freeman who
advocates strongly for documenting and preserving the history of chess in New Zealand, and who has provided much of the material
collected here. His personal <A HREF="http://poisonpawn.co.nz">Poison Pawn website</A> is an external resource with a wealth of historical
New Zealand chess material.
