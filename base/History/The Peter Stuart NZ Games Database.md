@HThe Peter Stuart NZ Games Database
The NZ Games Database that was created and maintained by the late Peter Stuart has been under NZCF stewardship since
April 2018.
</p><p>
Here is the latest update (20th June 2021) to the database in <a href="history/nzl2021-06-20.cbv">Chessbase (CBV) format</a> and
<a href="history/nzl2021-06-20.zip">zipped PGN format</a>.
</p><p>
Here is the accompanying NZ Championship Crosstable history in <a href="history/NZ Chp X-tables-2021.pdf">PDF format</a>
and editable <a href="history/NZ Chp X-tables-2021.odt">Open Document format</a> updated through 2021.
</p><p>
For reference purposes, here is the final edition of the database published by Peter himself in 2017, in
<a href="history/NZL2017.cbv">Chessbase (CBV) format</a> and <a href="history/NZL2017.pgn.zip">zipped PGN format</a>.
</p><p>
Here are two ancillary files Peter included, a <A href="history/README.TXT">README</A> and
the <A href="history/NZ Chp X-tables.pdf">NZ Championship Crosstable history</a> updated through 2017.
</p><p>
Peter's family graciously gave permission to NZCF to make this huge contribution to chess scholarship in New Zealand freely
available to all. We are committed to keeping the project alive and aspire to the same meticulous attention to detail that
characterised Peter's work for so long.
</p><p>
Thanks to Michael Whaley and Michael Freeman for working with Peter's family, and Helen Milligan for providing the most recent published version.
