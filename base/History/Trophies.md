@HChess Trophies in New Zealand
These pages are still under construction. Eventually we envisage a full list of the many interesting trophies awarded
in New Zealand. Please help by providing photos and/or commentary. Email <a href="mailto:billforsternz@gmail.com">billforsternz@gmail.com</a>. 
A slightly longer term goal is to provide full text transcriptions of each trophy.

The Silver Rook
@HThe Silver Rook
The Silver Rook is awarded each year to the New Zealand champion. This storied trophy is intimately
tied to our the long history of our National championship (the world's oldest) The trophy is widely
admired around the world, has a magnificent presence, and is very valuable. Consequently these days
it is kept securely at NZ chess HQ rather than trusted to the custody of individual chessplayers,
who of course don't have a tremendous reputation for reliability as a group in general. A little
like cricket's Ashes which sadly never leave the long room at Lord's even when 'held' by Australia.

Amongst many others, the trophy
bears the name of the late great IM Ortvin Sarapu no less than twenty times, an international record
for multiple wins of a national championship. <a href="trophies-silver-rook.html">More photos and a full list of champions</a>.

New Zealand Premier Reserve
@HNew Zealand Premier Reserve
The NZ Premier Reserve Championship was contested at Congress between the 52nd Congress in 1944/45 and the 103rd in 1995/96
inclusive. The Premier Reserve was introduced to supplement an elite twelve player round robin championship with a
similar secondary tournament for those players who didn't qualify for the championship. In 1996 it was decided that the
more flexible Swiss system Major Open (see below) was a sufficient supplement to the Championship.
</p><p>
The handsome Premier Reserve Trophy was dedicated to the memory of Lionel Goldsmith a New Zealand airman who was killed in
action, aged just 27, on 22nd September 1943 over Hanover during the air war against Germany. He was an air gunner in the
RNZAF 115 squadron, and was from Wellington, the son of Joseph and Deborah Goldsmith. Lionel and his brother was keen Wellington players,

New Zealand Major Open
@HNew Zealand Major Open
From the 95th Congress in 1987/88 a Swiss system Major Open was introduced for the many competitive players who are
below the elite NZ Championship level. This competition supplemented and in time completely replaced the Premier Reserve
Championship. The original Major Open trophy was the <a href="nzchessmag/pdfs/2012-04.pdf">Henry Hookham</a> cup, pictured left, donated to NZCF by ACI computer
services. This trophy was thought lost in 2013, and was rediscovered in 2021. In the intervening years a replacement
cup was used.  A full list of champions is available <a href="trophies-major-open.html">here</a>.
