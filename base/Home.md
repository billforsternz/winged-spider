@HCovid takes a toll
Sadly over the board chess in New Zealand has ground to a halt as the NZCF level 1 only policy means play throughout the country
has been suspended for weeks, with no end in sight. The scheduling carnage can clearly be seen in the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a>.
We can at least play online, including in <a href="https://lichess.org/team/new-zealand-chess-federation">two NZCF events each week</a> (Monday and Friday). These events are invariably good fun and are
capably organised by Timothy Ha.

@HGenesis Potini Remembered
Another New Zealand centric article has appeared in the British monthly magazine </i>CHESS</i> (earlier in 2021
an article about the rivalry between Russell Dive and Anthony Ker appeared, see below). As can be seen in the photo, this time the subject
is Gisborne chess organiser, player and coach the late Genesis Potini, subject of the 2014 film <i>The Dark Horse</i>.

The last two home page stories enjoyed some confluence as Ewen Green joined the fray at the <a href="https://lichess.org/swiss/SqMtxPRx">NZCF Friday night online Swiss</a>
and despite unfamiliarity with Lichess, came close to winning the tournament. Remember the <a href="https://lichess.org/team/new-zealand-chess-federation">NZCF online tournaments</a>
will keep running through lockdown and beyond, thanks again Timothy Ha.
Meanwhile the first stage of the FIDE online cadets tournament has come to an end, see the <a href="results.html">results page</a>. There has been some local
<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/126021643/late-knights-part-of-the-grand-master-plan-for-teen-in-world-chess-comp">mainstream media attention</a>.

@HFriday Night Online Swiss
Once again we have reverted to online only local chess (see the Covid information panel above). Hopefully not for too long. Many thanks to Timothy
Ha who keeps a regular series of <a href="https://lichess.org/team/new-zealand-chess-federation">NZCF online events</a> ticking over, ready for everyone
to jump back in at times like this.
</p><p>
The next event is <a href="https://lichess.org/swiss/SqMtxPRx">this Swiss tournament</a>, on Friday, Aug 20, at 7:30 pm. A Swiss tournament
should make a nice change from the usual online Arenas, note that Lichess still allows you late join, pause and exit flexibility (if you feel you must).

@HEwen Green Earns FIDE Veterans Award
<i>A message from NZCF President Nigel Metge</i>
</p><p>
It is with enormous pleasure I announce that NZ Chess Federation’s application to FIDE for Veterans Award to Ewen Green has been successful – one of just 27 awards for the world!
Every chess player in New Zealand congratulates Ewen on this most deserved award for a lifetime contribution to NZ chess.

Riccarton Racecourse
@HCongress at Riccarton
The 129th New Zealand Congress is to be held in Christchurch from 2-12 January 2022.
Preparations are well advanced, Craig Hall and his team have assembled an impressive set of sponsors
(Respectrum Insurance, Nail Perfect NZ, Chessventures, Kiwi Gaming Foundation, Christchurch City Council and the Racecourse Hotel and Motor Lodge)
and a commensurately attractive $10,000 prize fund. A special $120/night rate is available at the Racecourse Hotel and Motor Lodge – players
should contact them via their website at <a href="https://racecoursehotel.co.nz/">racecoursehotel.co.nz</a> and advise that they
are attending the chess tournament. This is a popular time of year for the hotel, so players are advised to book quickly.
</p><p>
Other accommodation options are also linked on the <a href="https://chess.org.nz/congress">Canterbury Chess Club website</a> .
Entries are already being accepted, see the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar page</a> for the entry form (which incidentally brings new standards of
presentation and ease of use - well done Craig!).

@HFIDE Online Olympiad, Peter Stuart Masters, NZCF Notices
Alert visitors to this website may have noticed a new <a href="notices.html">Notices</a> section which
will be the natural home for NZCF administrative notices from now on. Check out today's notice calling for
players to participate in the FIDE Online Olympiad - coming up soon!
</p><p>
Also in the news today - after positive feedback for the "George Trundle" and due to popular demand, the North Shore Chess Club has stepped up to organise another batch of 10 player, classical Olympiad time control
round robin tournaments with a one round per day schedule. Starting this year there will be two such annual events at the Auckland
Chess Centre, the "George Trundle Masters" (organised by the Auckland Chess Centre) and the "Peter Stuart Masters" (organised by North Shore
Chess Club). The inaugural Peter Stuart Masters starts on October 2nd, details on the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a>.

@HBest Games from the Waitakere Trusts
Each year Former NZCF President GM Murray Chandler judges the best games prize at the Trusts open and you
can see the results this year in <a href="nzchessmag/interactive/2021-07-trusts-best-games.html">a short issue of the NZ Chess Bulletin</a>. Philip Hair has
also contributed an article on an interesting transpositional device, "The Australian Attack". Perhaps
other readers will be inspired to contribute chess articles for this embryonic interactive online magazine.
</p><p>
Incidentally Murray has also recently supplied the final columns for this
<a href="history-listener.html">remarkable collection of magazine material</a>, freely available for your reading pleasure.
This is a real treasure trove. If New Zealand was a bigger country you could be sure these columns would be collected into
a popular series of books.

Otago Daily Times covers the secondary schools event in Dunedin
@HInterschools Championship
Up and down the country <a href="interschools.html">the NZCF's Interschools Championship</a> is gathering pace, working up to National
finals at Alexandra Park in October.  As the picture shows, sometimes the regional competitions attract attention in major
media outlets like the <a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/record-entry-secondary-schools-chess-tournament">Otago Daily Times</a>. Interschools co-ordinator Bob Smith, together with wife Viv
deserves particular credit for organising this competition each year. The Smiths also take on the substantial
task of running most of the tournaments within the Auckland metropolitan area, where interschool competition
is particularly hot as can be seen in <a href="intschoolsresults2021.html">this year's results page</a>.

@HNZ Games Database Updated
The <a href="history-games-database.html">Peter Stuart Games Database</a> has just been updated. This database,

and also NZ games in international competition. Club and tournament administrators can help by submitting
PGN files to the <a href="mailto:billforsternz@gmail.com">NZCF web administrator</a> for possible inclusion.

@H43rd Trusts Chess Open
An impressive 152 players crowded into the Te Pai Centre. Australian IM Brodie McClymont enjoyed the bubble more than most this weekend, taking out
New Zealand’s premier standard chess weekender with an impressive A Grade score of 6/6,
1.5 points clear of second place. Results and details are now on the <a href="results.html">Results page</a>.

Gordon Lyall with tournament winner Russell Dive
@HRussell wins at Kāpiti, again
In recent years the annual Kāpiti Rapid has gone from strength to strength, becoming a really important feature of
the chess scene in the entire region. A lot of credit must go to the Kāpiti Club's leadership group, led by
club president Gordon Lyall.
</p><p>
Some things don't change though. The first Kāpiti Rapid in 1991 was won by Russell
Dive and Jonathan Sarfati. The 2021 event was won by Russell, pictured receiving his prize from Gordon, again. I'm
sure Russell would like to thank Andrew Brockway, normally an unsung hero of Wellington chess administration, for
his assistance. Andrew pulled off a huge upset by defeating Russell's perennial rival Anthony Ker.

Allen Fan
@HAllen Fan selected for the World Cup
NZCF has selected 17 year old FM Allen Fan to represent NZ at the World Cup in Sochi, Russia, to be played from July 10th.
Allen started playing chess at five and credits his parents for dedicating countless hours of time and effort to his chess
ambitions, including travelling with him to international youth competitions. Allen has enjoyed participating in global
online competitions, but is pleased to be selected for a prestigious over-the-board event as Covid (hopefully) wanes. He is
intent on doing everything he can to progress further and eventually become an IM. (<b>Update</b>: Sadly unavailability of
a MIQ [Covid Managed Isolation] slot for his return meant Allen could not take up his place at the World Cup).

@HPoppies Chess Challenge
Once again Paul Spiller has organised a July promotional match at Poppies Bookshop in Howick.

Articles on Nic Croad (New in Chess, left) and Anthony Ker and Russell Dive (CHESS Monthly, right)
@HNZ Chess Gets International Attention
Internationally, chess is still largely confined to online only play due to the continuing havoc wrought
by Covid-19. New Zealand's success at controlling Covid-19 has been an international story, and in the
chess world normal over-the-board play here is a source of both curiosity and just a little envy. This
situation has led to the unusual situation of New Zealand chess featuring in the current issues
of both New In Chess (2021#2, left) and CHESS Monthly (April 2021, right).

Auckland University Chess Association Executive Team
@HAuckland University Chess Association
They are not (yet?) affiliated with NZCF, but the Auckland University Chess Association
might be the largest chess club in the country, with over 480 members drawn from the University of Auckland
and Auckland University of Technology. The club has started running competitive tournaments,
<a href="https://newzealandchess.nz/auca-imc-chess-tournament/">their biggest and most ambitious one to date</a>
was a one day 25+5 rapid immediately after Easter that drew 75 entrants
and featured attractive prizes, including trips to Sydney provided by their generous sponsor IMC trading.
</p><p>
The photo shows the club's Executive Team. You can now find all the club's details, and read more about it

Wellington Club President Ross Jackson with Gawain Jones
@HGawain does it again at the North Island Champs
It wasn't quite as easy as the <a href="results.html">scoreboard suggests</a>, the last two rounds in particular against FM Daniel Gong and
IM Anthony Ker were long grinds that were the last games to finish. But GM Gawain Jones has "picket-fenced" again. Gawain's
last event in New Zealand is the Bob Wade Memorial Rapid in Auckland on the 10th of April. Can he keep it up
and avoid conceding even a draw in official competition on this NZ trip? No pressure Gawain.
</p><p>
Meanwhile the consensus of opinion seemed to be that the tournament was a huge success. We're not sure if it's
an all time record (when your web administrator finally gets the <a href="archives.html">Archives</a> into shape we'll
know), but the 92 entries were about twice the organiser's expectations. Would the venue even cope? In the end everyone
was accommodated comfortably, and Cuba Street was buzzing throughout to provide a great inner city vibe as a background,
happily with none of the noise problems that can sometimes bring.
</p><p>
<b>Update:</b> North Island residents Felix Xie and Athula Kankanamge came 2nd= on 6.5/8 and so become
joint North Island Champions for 2021.

@HNic Croad Competing in the Oceania Zone Hybrid
A new and interesting chess format is being trialled in New Zealand and around the Oceania region over the weekends of March 20-21
and March 27-28. Hybrid chess is an attempt to marry traditional chess and online chess, with a view to eventually allowing official rated
competition between geographically distributed competitors. Instead of playing at home, the players compete from "hubs" under the
control and supervision of qualified arbiters. Our own Paul Spiller, president of FIDE's Zone 3.6 describes the
competition Nic Croad is competing in <a href="https://auschess.org.au/oceania-hybrid-3-6-zonal-2021/">here</a>.
Basically it's a round robin classical tournament, two rounds a day, featuring two Australian GMs amongst others (Nic plays
both GMs on Saturday 20th). At stake is decent prize money, and a qualifying spot for the world cup. Rounds are at 1pm and 7pm NZ
time, and a link will be put up here in time for you to follow the action. <b>Update:</b> The promised link has not yet
been delivered by the organisers, but it should appear <a href="https://livechess.aunz.net/">on this page</a> before start of play.
<b>Update 2:</b> Hopefully <a href="https://livechess.aunz.net/oceania-zonal-3-6/">this is the actual link</a>. <b>Update 3:</b>
Final results are now on the <a href="results.html">Results page</a>.

Riga, Latvia
@HLatvian Rapid
March 20th sees the 2021 edition of the <a href="calendar.html">Latvian Rapid</a>, New Zealand's biggest weekend rapid. It's particularly
welcome this year as last year it was amongst the first Covid casualties. A big turnout is expected, as NZ
enjoys a post Queen's Gambit / Covid chess boom (see for example the pictures from the <a href="results.html">Otago Autumn Rapid</a>).
</p><p>
Many people wonder why
it's called the Latvian. I thought the answer is that it started life as a Latvian Gambit theme tournament. After posting this, Rowan
Wood quickly pointed out that <a href="https://www.hpchessclub.org.nz/members.htm">the Howick Pakuranga website</a> provides a more detailed
and nuanced explanation, including a delightful story featuring NZCF Life members Ortvin Sarapu and Tony Booth. After making quick work of Tony's Latvian
at the Latvian, Ortvin offered the following wisdom "Mr Booth, never play the Latvian Gambit against an Estonian". Friend of NZ chess IM
Herman van Riemsdijk played the Latvian Gambit versus Romanishin at the Riga (pictured) Interzonal in 1979 (1-0 in 27). Afterwards
the local press were flattered and excited "Is this the first time you've played the Latvian?". Herman's reply was quick "No it's the
last time".

@HGrandmasterly Manoeuvring
Elite GM Gawain Jones (newly crowned European online blitz champion), and his wife Sue Maroroa are of course regular visitors to our shores.
It's lovely to see them both back again, despite the Covid maelstrom. In fact the trip has
even been extended and Gawain is now a confirmed participant in a series of local events
starting with the Latvian Rapid on March 20th, continuing with the North Island Champs from
April 2nd-5th and finishing with the Bob Wade memorial on April 10th. The photo shows

Another Covid hiccup, another online tournament organised by Timothy Ha. This time it's a
<a href="https://lichess.org/tournament/RpyKGCiU">Monday night team battle</a>. With the

tournaments, we might be having more of them!

@HBay of Plenty Rapid
The Bay of Plenty Rapid, to be held this year on Saturday February 27th, is one of most popular weekend
rapids in the country. As tournament supremo Caleb Wright likes to point out, it's the longest running
tournament with the now ubiquitous 25+5 time control made possible by digital clocks. If you can
remember the bad old days, you'll know what a big step it was to eliminate the chaos,
confusion and injustice of guillotine finishes with dangling analog flags.

of the most beautiful regions in the country.

@HOn Sailing, Chess and Covid
America's Cup Organisers and Teams spend millions on lawyers and insanely elaborate rules, yet they can't
quite figure out whether their rules allow competition at the moment. Or not. Perhaps they should have
hired NZCF as (very reasonably priced) legal consultants, our rules are crystal clear. Chess is on at
Level One, suspended at Level Two and above. Sadly this means that in Auckland chess clubs remain closed
for at least a little while longer. But never fear the indefatigable Timothy Ha has organised another
<a href="https://lichess.org/tournament/HoIKrVpi">Friday night online tournament</a> so chess addicts
in Auckland and nationwide can still get their fix.

@snippet
@HNZCF Online Tournament, plus a Covid Reminder
Sadly the NZCF Covid Policy (see purple box above) has been activated again. The entire country is currently
above level 1 for three days (at least). The NZCF online tournaments have understandably been quiet for a while,
but maybe this <a href="https://lichess.org/tournament/bnZ6hjBz">Monday night tournament</a> is a good
opportunity to commiserate with the local chess community about this hopefully very temporary setback. Thanks to
Timothy Ha for keeping the tournaments going, and for hastily organising and promoting this one.

@HTournaments, Tournaments, Tournaments
After missing out on so many tournaments in 2020, we are now bathing in an abundance of regular and new events.
Please check out the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar Page</a> and enjoy your options. We have already had a
successful Congress. Auckland Chess Centre has put on an Anniversary Weekender and is following up in short
order with a Waitangi Weekender and an ANZAC Weekender a bit further down the track. Howick Pakuranga's Latvian
Rapid is now the single biggest weekend rapid in the country. The Summit Chess Club is
running its full program of junior events. The Bay of Plenty and Hawkes Bay Rapids are coming up soon in reliably
gorgeous parts of New Zealand. The North Island Champs are on over Easter Weekend in Wellington. A bit later on
you must pencil in the 43rd Trusts Open. (Late in the year the NZ Women's Championship has been revised).
</p><p>
A special mention is due to a special new event, the Bob Wade memorial
on Bob's 100th anniversary, April 10th 2021. Thanks to Paul Spiller for conceiving of this event and making it a
reality.

@HKasparov Chess Foundation University Cup
The Kasparov Chess Foundation is a substantial supporter and sponsor of chess in New Zealand, particularly
our annual Congresses. On February 6th-7th they are running a free online event for university teams. It
would be marvellous if one or more New Zealand university teams could compete. All the details are on the
event website <a href="https://chess.stream/kcf_university_cup/">here</a>. If you are tempted to enter
please send an email to NZCF Vice President Paul Spiller or NZCF web administrator Bill Forster
(email addresses on the <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a>) to let us know.
<br><b>Update:</b> A Victoria University of Wellington team (Ryan Winter, Michael Sole, Nicholas Heyworth, Ben Bryant)
competed  despite a very hostile time zone and posted a solid mid table performance, 64th from 125, see the results page

@HThank You Murray
New NZCF President Nigel Metge can be seen handing out the prizes in the congress photos below and on
the <a href="results.html">Results Page</a> (he also picked up a grade prize in the Blitz:). For those who haven't realised
it yet, this does indeed mean that GM Murray Chandler has handed over the baton. Hopefully Murray will
quietly continue to contribute to the NZ chess scene in an unofficial capacity. The maintainer of this website
would like to take the opportunity to post a personal thank you to Murray for his wise counsel and steadfast
support for a shared vision of a steadily improving, focussed, local, tasteful, coherent and comprehensive
website for the New Zealand chess community.

@HA Most Excellent Congress
The 128th Congress in Palmerston North came to a successful conclusion, with Felix Xie breaking through
with a remarkable win to secure the NZ Rapid Championship. Chief organiser Mark Noble, and arbiter
Craig Hall did an outstanding job with this congress. Thanks are also due to dual sponsor and venue
provider Copthorne Hotels, and sponsor the Kasparov Chess Foundation. The photo here shows new NZ
Champion Nic Croad happily receiving the famous Silver Rook. New NZCF President Nigel Metge and young
Arthur Croad clearly also approve.

@HHowick Pakuranga Christmas Tournament Goes Off
Paul Spiller reports that the first Howick Pakuranga Christmas tournament was a massive success. Clearly
the enforced diet has made the chess community hungry for over-the-board tournaments. There were 126 entries
with over 60 under the age of 12. FM Daniel Gong emerged victorious. Full results and more photos on the

@H128th NZ Chess Congress
After a challenging 2020, chess life in New Zealand has largely returned to normal, and chess enthusiasts have
an ideal opportunity to celebrate in the pleasant provincial city of Palmerston North, scene of the 128th
NZ Congress, from January 2nd. As well as the traditional Championship and Major Open in luxuriant nine day one round per day
formats, there are plenty of other events to play in, including an intriguing novelty event - in which you and
your opponent effectively play a mini simul against each other! Intrigued? Check the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a> for details.

Still from Queens Gambit Netflix series
@HApparently Chess is Finally Cool
According to this article in
<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/123492451/how-netflixs-the-queens-gambit-is-finally-making-chess-cool">stuff.co.nz</a>
anyway. The catalyst is the Netflix series "The Queen's Gambit" which has
been a smash hit all around the world. NZCF Vice President Paul Spiller is quoted intensively in the article. If you haven't seen
the show, it's well worth a look. Although the chess purist will find a lot of details to quibble over (the tempo of play, the false
notes when chess players are talking to chess players about chess, the rather odd portrayal of expert commentary at some events), some
artistic license must be granted and the producers deserve a lot of credit for giving the game far more respect than is customary in
film and television. The positions, openings and games are authentic (barring an occasional detail or two). Garry Kasparov was even
hired to craft some appropriately brilliant games (he based them on hypothetical variations from Grandmaster practice I believe).
Reaction from the chess community has in large part being very positive.

@HPresident's Report 2020
NZCF President GM Murray Chandler has sent his annual report to member clubs. You can read the report
<a href="downloads/PRESIDENT'S REPORT 2020.pdf">here</a>. At the end of the report Murray reveals that sadly he will be stepping down from the role
at the 2021 AGM in January. The New Zealand chess community is indebted to Murray for his many years of excellent administrative work, which will hopefully
continue in some other capacity.

Kapiti Rapid, juniors at the front
@HKapiti Rapid
The most recent annual Kapiti Rapid tournaments have broken attendence records for an event that kept a low profile for many years. So
it was a big disappointment when Covid-19 cancellation seemed to break the momentum this year. But never fear, the event has been
rescheduled and is all set to go on November 21st as over-the-board chess continues to re-emerge in New Zealand. Top players like Ben Hague
will be there, shouldn't you be too? Check the details on the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar Page</a>.

there have been some outages.

@HDrama at the Asian Online Nations Champs
In the first round of the Open competition New Zealand were drawn to play chess superpower India. Play commenced after a delay, but something was
wrong, not only did all GM India have an average rating advantage of 600 Elo points or so, they had White on every board! Eventually the round was
aborted and after a big delay play finally got going for real this time. After four well contested games, NZL did eventually yield on all four
boards, but not before winning respect from the Indian commentary team for competing strongly. Ben Hague garnered particular plaudits for a very
sporting gesture: Clearly worse when the games were aborted, he decided that he didn't deserve a reprieve and voluntarily played to the same position
to continue the original game. Check the coverage between 1:20 and 2:00 approx in this (rather charming) <a href="https://youtu.be/ggilaaqAsZc">Youtube video</a>.

@HNZ at the FIDE Online Olympiad
New Zealand competed at the <a href="https://olymp.fide.com/">FIDE Online Olympiad</a> on the evenings of
Friday, Saturday and Sunday 7th-9th August. An unexpectedly kind schedule. We played in Division 3 Pool A,
a ten team round robin and we needed a top three placing to stay in the competition. Unfortunately we were never really ever in contention
and ultimately came seventh. Congratulations to Singapore, Ireland and Albania. We fell into a pattern of winning one match and losing two each day. Never mind,
it was all good fun, the players enjoyed it and the youngsters in particular will be better for the experience.

Alphaeus Ang, then and now
@HFM Alphaeus Ang's Remarkable Record
The West Auckland Secondary Interschool Chess Championship held on August 5th (see <a href="intschoolsresults2020.html">interschools results</a>)
was significant for FM Alphaeus Ang. It marks the final NZCF West Auckland Interschool Chess series that
Alphaeus will be eligible to play in. Each year for eleven years in succession now Alphaeus had played as board one for his school's A (best) team.
Amazingly (could this be a world record?) Alphaeus has picket fenced every year, winning all games in all rounds, in all years. The streak
started with Alphaeus a year 3 in St. Paul's Primary School playing the Primary division in 2010 (the photo shows Alphaeus at this age) and
concludes unbeaten and unbroken with Alphaeus a year 13 at Liston College in the Secondary division. Alphaeus also played for Liston College
in the Intermediate division. Interschools chess in Auckland is known for keen and unforgiving competition, this is not an easy arena in
which to excel. Thanks to the Waitakere Chess Club for running the event through it's history.

@HNZCF Online Arenas, Friday Evenings
One of the few redeeming features of the Covid-19 lockdown in New Zealand was the fun online chess events that could include
players from around the country with no need to take time off, arrange accommodation, book flights etc. etc. It would be a
pity not to at least attempt to recapture the fun of those events and keep them going, especially as the organisational structure
is already in place. As an experiment, NZCF Online Arena tournaments are going to be held on Friday evenings at 7:30pm for the
rest of the month. Get started on the <a href="https://lichess.org/team/new-zealand-chess-federation">NZCF Lichess page</a>. If
there's good support they'll be fun and worth continuing. If there's not good support ..... well draw your own conclusions.

Brian Foster with young charges, Wainuiomata 1978
@HBrian Foster 1937-2020
NZCF is saddened to announce the death of Brian Foster, on his 83rd birthday, after a lengthy illness.
A private Family Service has been held on Friday 26th June.
</p><p>
Brian was initially a keen player but it was as a club organiser he made his first key contribution to New Zealand chess.
In 1972, as President of Pencarrow Chess Club, he organised weekly training for around 100 keen juniors inspired to take
up the game by the famous Fischer-Spassky match. Remarkably this group from the tiny town of Wainuiomata went on to produce

Later, together with his wife Colleen, Brian founded New Zealand Chess Supplies. They subsequently moved the home-based
mail-order business to Greytown. Their chess bookstalls, with an incredible range of chess literature and equipment,
will be fondly remembered by many players attending tournaments from the 1980s until just a few years ago, when Brian’s
poor health forced the sale of the main business.
</p><p>
In January of this year Brian and Colleen received a NZCF President’s Award for Services to New Zealand Chess, in recognition
of both Brian’s remarkable work encouraging junior players, and the wonderful chess supplies business they ran for many years.

@HFormer NZ Champs Cross Swords
Prolific chess organiser and promoter Paul Spiller has cooked up something a little bit different
to showcase the game in an unusual setting, at least for chess.
Former NZ Champs FMs Martin Dreyer and Ewen Green are going to play a blitz match at Poppies book shop
in Howick on Saturday July 18th. The suburban retail heartland can
be something of a cultural desert, so hopefully there's an eager audience for something that stretches
the mind. Perhaps there will be some people who will be surprised and intrigued to discover that chess
is not only the ultimate mind sport, it can be dynamic, fast moving and fun too.

There are now photos, games and results on the <a href="results.html">Results page</a>.

@HPeter Stuart, a Memorial Tournament and a Database Update
In a sign that chess in New Zealand may be returning to a semblance of its normal self
the <a href="https://newzealandchess.nz/2020/02/peter-stuart-memorial-chess-open/">Peter Stuart Memorial Tournament</a> for 2020
has recently been added to the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a> and confirmed as running as normal (assuming NZ remains at
Covid-19 Alert level 1 or lower).
</p><p>
So it's fitting perhaps that an update to the Peter Stuart NZ Games database is now available. See the
<a href="history-games-database.html">Peter Stuart database page</a>. The update includes many recently rediscovered early games of NZ's only
Grandmaster, NZCF President Murray Chandler, plus games from the recent <a href="nzchessmag/interactive/2020-06.html">NZ Chess Bulletin</a>, plus
some additional recent online interclub games. Finally Greek chess scholar Spyridon Louris has provided a valuable supplement to the historical
game collection, 34 complete games from the 17th NZ Congress held in Wellington in the summer of 1904-05.
These games were transcribed from contemporary accounts, thank you Spyridon.

@HNZCF Official Interschools Competition 2020 restarts
Due to the Government moving to Covid-19 Level one as of 9th June, the New Zealand Chess Federation
Interschools committee has taken the decision to immediately restart this popular nationalwide
competition. There are some minor changes to cater for time lost:
<ul>
<li>
Regional Qualification events will now have until 22nd August to take place (an extension of one week).
</li><li>
Qualified teams intending to play in the Finals in Mount Maunganui must register by 8th September
(an extension of one week).
</li><li>
Where it is no longer possible for a Regional Qualification event to be staged, the Interschools
Committee may select teams from that Region for the final.
</li>
</ul>
The Interschools Finals will take place as previously scheduled 26-27 September 2020 in Mount Maunganui.
For further information please see the Interschools page at <a href="interschools.html">interschools.html</a>
or email the Interschools Coordinator Bob Smith, e-mail <a href="mailto:caissa1530@gmail.com">caissa1530@gmail.com</a>.
Schools please note that only official NZCF Interschools qualifying events generate qualifiers for
the New Zealand Interschools National Finals.

@HChess Clubs to re-open under Covid-19 Level One
Today the Government announced that, with zero active cases of Covid-19, New Zealand would
be moving to Level One from midnight tonight. The Government website states that “At Alert Level
1, everyone can return without restriction to work, school, sports and domestic travel, and you
can get together with as many people as you want”.
</p><p>
There are no mandatory Social Distancing rules, though the Government website suggests continuing
to keep track of where we’ve been and who we’ve seen to assist with rapid contact tracing if it
is required.
</p><p>
Therefore from tomorrow there is no Government restriction and chess clubs are free to open again.
</p><p>
Individual Clubs may wish to consider taking various hygiene measures involving extra cleaning
going forward. NZCF Council will be having an e-meeting this week to consider whether to publish
a list of guidelines for this specific to chess.
</p><p>
Murray Chandler, NZCF President
</p><p>
(This website will be returning to normal operation soon - with the calendar being unfrozen, and
hopefully with normal chess activity beginning to be logged once again. Thank you for your patience
and good behaviour during these difficult times)

@HInterclub Highlights
The Asian Junior Championships have been completed with three NZL players competing in both the <a href="https://chess-results.com/tnr528219.aspx?lan=1">Girls</a>
and <a href="https://chess-results.com/tnr528221.aspx?lan=1">Open</a>
sections. Our representatives had a tough time, but will be better for the experience.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, New Zealand seems to be on a path to Covid-19 Alert Level 1, which hopefully will mean
a return to normal chess activity in this part of the world at least. For the moment, we are still
enjoying a lot of light online entertainment, and some highlights have been captured in a new
issue of the <a href="nzchessmag/interactive/2020-06.html">NZ Chess Bulletin</a>.

@HOnline Chess Update
As previously reported, the Asian Chess Federation are running an Asian Junior Championship online.
There has been plenty of interest locally, and so we are running a New Zealand Qualifier event
on Saturday 16th May to find the three local representatives. Get your entries in quickly because
they close on Friday 15th May at 5pm (just a day after posting this, things move fast online!).
Qualifier information is <a href="downloads/NZCF Qualifier to Asian Junior (Online Rapid) 2020.pdf">here</a>,

<b>Update</b>:
The Asian Junior Championship <a href="downloads/AsianJuniors2020-Overview.jpg">overview</a>,
and <a href="downloads/AsianJuniors2020-Detailed-Regulations.pdf">detailed regulations</a> have both
changed substantially the day before the previously announced close of entries! Changes include
prize money, time control and a separate girls  competition. Never-the-less congratulations to
Daniel Gong (1st, 7/7), Allen Fan and Michael Sole (2nd= 5/7) who qualified for the open competition
from our qualifier held on Saturday 16th May. The event went well considering this was a first for an event of this type in
New Zealand. Many thanks to Matt McNabb, Timothy Ha and especially arbiter Craig Hall who shouldered extra
burdens (technology quirks etc) and handled them all with aplomb. Full results on <a href="tournaments/ch/2020/wwwOnlineAsianJuniorQualifier2020/index.html">Vega</a>,

Another entertaining interclub event was held on Tuesday 12th May, with Auckland Chess Centre emerging
victorious, but notable showings from Hamilton and New Plymouth Chess Clubs. More details are available
on the <a href="online-interclub.html">online interclub page</a>. The <a href="https://lichess.org/team/new-zealand-chess-federation">NZCF online chess club</a> had another strong outing. Remember that the NZCF club
holds individual tournaments on alternate Tuesdays. The next event on Tuesday 19th May is a Swiss not
an Arena, a new Lichess feature. The time control is 5+3, which will appeal to players who want a bit
more time than a normal blitz game.

@HAnnouncement from the New Zealand Chess Federation re Covid-19 Level 2
The anticipated upcoming transition to Level 2 restrictions will not affect the current position
for chess. No official NZCF over-the-board chess tournaments or NZCF/FIDE rated games will take
place in New Zealand on Level 2. Two further upcoming tournaments have now been cancelled, the
New Zealand Junior Championship, and the North island Championship, both scheduled for this July.
</p><p>
Because chess is a game where the players sit indoors in close proximity, over lengthy periods,
NZCF Council takes the view that New Zealand needs to move to Level 1 before official tournament
competition can resume.

@HAsian Junior Championship (Online!)
The Asian Chess Federation in cooperation with Chess.com have announced that they will organize
official Asian chess championships online in various categories starting with the Asian Junior
Chess Championship 27 May-3 June 2020.
</p><p>
The competition format will begin with seven Zonal championships daily from 27th May to 2nd June
2020. Each federation can field up to 3 players aged under-20 to the multi-federation Zonals.
The top 3 of each Zone qualify into the Finals. Both stages will be 7-round Swiss System tournaments.
Eliglble NZL registered junior players interested in playing as New Zealand reps should email Craig Hall at
<a href="mailto:canterbury@chess.org.nz">canterbury@chess.org.nz</a> as soon as possible.
</p><p>
It is quite likely that a qualifier and/or a New Zealand practice tournament will be run by NZCF
before the event proper. Playing conditions will require players to be visible at all times using
an on-screen camera using Zoom.
</p><p>
Further information will be published here as it becomes available, we apologise for the late
notice which was due to circumstances beyond our control.

<b>Update 27 April 2020: </b>The <a href="https://lichess.org/tournament/tnjyUIgc">first match</a> is coming up fast and there are now 10 clubs entered. It's not too late to get involved, but don't
leave it to the last minute! The great majority of players have ignored my pleas to use their real name, and consequently the chat will be full of
"Who is XenaWarriorPrincess2003?" etc. and in general no one will know who anyone else is. You were warned.

@HAuckland v Wellington v Christchurch Online Chess Match
Another inter city/club chess match was played on Lichess on Easter Monday.

These matches are likely to become regular events, look out for announcements on <a href="nz-chess-online.html">The Online Page</a>.
</p><p>
Here is a <a href="downloads/auckland-v-wellington-2020-april-01.pgn">PGN</a> of the earlier Auckland v Wellington
clash. PGN games with internet handles have very little long term interest or value, so this PGN sees
all such handles replaced with real player names. This policy meant I had to discard games for which
I didn't know who both players actually were. Please, don't be a part of this problem, play under your
actual name - or, at the very least add your name to your Lichess profile so I can track you down. I
will make a similar PGN for the Easter Monday battle and I will regenerate the Auckland v Wellington
PGN if more mystery players let me know who they are. Late update: Timothy Ha livestreamed the Auck v Wgtn match

@HOlympiad 2021 Team Will Be Reselected
NZCF announces that regrettably the 2020 NZ Olympiad selections are annulled due to circumstances beyond everyone’s control,
A new selection procedure will take in due course, possibly at the end of the year, assuming the Olympiad is able to take
place in 2021. NZCF sympathises with the affected players, but as any replacement event will be a minimum of 18 months
after the original applications, this is just too big a gap.
</p><p>
In the event of the selectors having to choose between two very close candidates for the 2021 Olympiad, they may give
preference to the one from the 2020 team.

@HCOVID-19 announcement from the New Zealand Chess Federation
In view of the COVID-19 virus situation, and in line with New Zealand Government advice on preventing transmission, the New Zealand Chess Federation Council passes the following resolution:
</p><p>
1. All NZCF Regional Interschools events for 2020 are cancelled until further notice
</p><p>
2. NZCF does not sanction or support the staging of any tournaments in New Zealand until further notice. Any such tournaments that take place will not be rated or recognised by the Federation, and no such events scheduled prior to 30th June shall be advertised on the NZCF Calendar.
</p><p>
3. NZCF strongly advises all Chess Clubs, whether affiliated to NZCF or not, to suspend activities.
</p><p>
It is with great regret that NZCF Council takes such a step. As chess is a game where the two players sit in close proximity of each other for lengthy periods of time, NZCF Council feels it appropriate to err on the side of caution in these unprecedented times.
</p><p>
NZCF Council will review the position at the end of June 2020.

@HNZCF announces 2020 Grand Prix cancelled 17/03/2020
After consultation with the sponsors, NZCF Council has taken the difficult decision to cancel
the NZ Chess Grand Prix for 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Already two significant 2020
events (the New Zealand Senior and the Latvian) have been postponed/cancelled, and many chess
clubs have taken the decision to shut doors temporarily. It is by now abundantly clear that
2020 is going to be a time of extraordinary challenges, especially for the staging of public
events for which people are required to travel.
</p><p>
Our sponsors Michael Freeman (Poison Pawn) and Martin Dreyer (D & D Financial Consultants Ltd)
have both provided extremely generous past support for the annual Grand Prix, for which the
chess community are most grateful. Michael advises that he hopes to stage a final type of
special Poison Pawn event in 2021.

@HCOVID-19: Asian Chess Federation Postpones All Events
<b>Announcement from Murray Chandler, NZCF President 13/3/2020</b>
</p><p>
The COVID-19 virus – now officially a pandemic – has already resulted in numerous overseas
chess tournament postponements or cancellations. Now the Asian Chess Federation has sent an
official notification to NZCF that all of their events will be postponed to await developments.
The first affected  will be the Asian Amateur in Oman, which had been scheduled for April.
The announcement can be seen <a href="downloads/Asian Chess Federation Postpones All Events.pdf">here</a>.
</p><p>
NZCF has not received any notification from FIDE, the World Chess Federation, regarding the
status of the Moscow Olympiad in August. New Zealand would normally have a squad of about
15 players, officials and accompanying persons attending. Given that many large international
sporting events are currently postponing competitions, and travel restrictions are ramping up
worldwide, we are currently contacting selected players to advise they do not book tickets at
this stage. We will keep players updated with news as it is received from FIDE. (<b>Update 25/3/2020,
the Olympiad has been postponed for a year</b>).
</p><p>
<b>Update 3 17/3/2020.</b> The 2020 Wellington Open has been cancelled.
</p><p>
<b>Update 2 16/3/2020.</b> The Latvian Rapid scheduled for this weekend has been postponed. Please
read the thoughtful announcement by Martin Dreyer on the <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Update 1 15/3/2020.</b> The NZ Senior Championships have now been postponed until September, see the
<a href="calendar.html">calendar</a>. This is unlikely to be the last effect of the Covid-19
Pandemic on the domestic schedule. Further changes will be prominently reported here if and when they
occur.

George Trundle
@HGeorge Trundle Masters
Since the first George Trundle Masters was held in 2006, this tournament (running at the Auckland Chess Centre
from January 4th 2020) has become an important feature of chess in New Zealand. Before the "George", IM Norm
opportunities for NZ players were few and far between. The late George Trundle (1918-2011, pictured), changed that by sponsoring
this tournament, and his bequest continues to fund it. George Trundle was an officer and a gentleman, and a hugely
popular figure in the local chess community. He loved chess more than most, after learning the game helped him
get through World War II as a prisoner in the challenging environment of Stalag VII A. Hopefully this superb tournament will
continue to honour his memory for many years to come.
