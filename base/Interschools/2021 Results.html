                            <br>A record 18 teams from eight schools played for the sixteenth annual Otago/Southland Secondary Interschool Teams' Championship on Saturday 19 June. Because of Covid 19 the competition was held later in the calendar than usual. Southland were again not able to hold their own competition this year, which meant four teams travelled up to the Logan Park High School Library, the same venue as last year. Three more teams from Waitaki Boys' HS travelled down from Oamaru.
                            <br>
                            <br>The <a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/record-entry-secondary-schools-chess-tournament">Otago Daily Times covered</a> the event.
                            <br>
                            <br>Match Points with Game Points as a tie-break meant once again that the result was in contention right to the last round, but in fact a critical match turned out to be in round 2. Defending champions Logan Park HS A went down to Southland BHS 3-1. Round 3 saw SBHS establish a clear lead when they narrowly defeated John McGlashan A 2½-1½ to move to 3/3, while Otago Boys HS A and Kings HS A fought out a 2-2 draw on the top table. In round 4 SBHS defeaed OBHS A 3-1 to keep their lead, while James Hargest A beat Kings HS A to be in sole 2nd place on 3½/4 having drawn their opening match. Because of the large turnout and close fought games, the number of scheduled rounds was reduced to six at this point to finish on time. In the Southland derby on top table in round 5, SBHS prevailed 3-1 to take their score to 5/5 and a point lead over LPHS A, who only just managed to beat the LPHS B team 3-1 when top board Alexander Sun pulled off a swindle in a losing queen endgame against Tyne Grant. With no other team on more than 3½ points, only a loss in the final round could take the title from SBHS. They were paired with Kings HS A and the result went right to the wire with SBHS securing wins on boards 1 and 3 to manage a 2-2 draw and take the championship trophy for 2021. With Southland a separate region to Otago, there was very strong interest in the second table where LPHS A were facing off against OBHS A for the right to represent Otago at the national finals. Playing without their top board Alex Sun, LPHS A managed to narrowly win 2½-1½ to move to 5 match points, sole 2nd place and the ticket to the finals. Three teams tied for third on 4 match points: James Hargest A, Kings HS A and Kings HS B. James Hargest A had the highest countback with 16 games points to take 3rd prize.
                            <br>
                            <br>Leading individual scorers were;
                            <br>Board 1: Atlas Kerr (SBHS) 6/6, Noah Oseki (OBHS A) 4½/6, Alex Sun (LPHS A) 4/5, Oscar Lobb (JMC A) 4/6, Tyne Grant (LPHS B) 4/6, Calan McDermott (Kings B) 4/6, Roland Cameron (James Hargest C) 4/6;
