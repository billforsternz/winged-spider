@H2021 New Zealand Interschool Chess Finals Cancelled
<i>Notice dated 13th November 2021</i>
NZCF Council has made the difficult decision to cancel this year’s national interschool finals.
<br>The finals were due to be held in Auckland in late December, after the covid pandemic forced their postponement from September.
<br>However holding the competition has become virtually impossible in view of the continuing uncertainty about Auckland’s covid level status and the rules regarding gatherings of vaccinated and unvaccinated people.
<br>My apologies; for the sake of thousands of keen young chess players around the country I can only hope that we can return to some normality next year.
