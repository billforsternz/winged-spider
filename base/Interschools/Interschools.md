@HNational Interschool Finals postponed until December
<i>Notice dated 7th September 2021</i>
</p><p>
The National Interschool Finals will now be held on 18th and 19th December.
</p><p>
The venue remains Alexandra Park in Auckland and all other details are the
same.
</p><p>
With Auckland still in Level Four and very unlikely to reach the required Level
One by the original dates of 2nd and 3rd October, NZCFâ€™s Interschool Committee
and National Finals Organiser Bruce Pollard have decided that the change of
dates will give participating schools more certainty and make it easier to plan
travel and accommodation.
</p><p>
Schools now have until 1st October to confirm their entries and team lists, using
the official entry form.
</p><p>
The deadline for payment of entry fees has been extended until 1st December.
</p><p>
Thank you to all the schools which have already confirmed their entries and
paid the entry fee.
</p><p>
If the new dates change your decision please advise Bruce
<a href="mailto:bruce.pollard@ymail.com">bruce.pollard@ymail.com</a>
and me <a href="mailto:caissa1530@gmail.com">caissa1530@gmail.com</a>.
</p><p>
We look forward to another enjoyable and exciting Interschool Final.
