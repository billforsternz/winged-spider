@HKeeping Local Chess Alive During the Covid-19 Crisis
<i>These pages will be kept up for the time being. Although chess life has largely returned to normal
in New Zealand, there are still (hopefully temporary) occasions where Covid level 2 or higher returns and
local chess goes back online.</i>
</p><p>
I will attempt to provide a
one stop directory of activity here, but I need people to let me know what they are doing.
If you are organising online local chess in New Zealand, please email
me <a href="mailto:billforsternz@gmail.com">billforsternz@gmail.com</a> and provide me with
a link that I can list here. See our article on <a href="running-chess-clubs-online.html">Running chess clubs online</a>
for ideas for getting your club online if it's not already.

@HPapatoetoe Chess Club
Stan Yee reports: We simply set up the club on chess.com before Level 4 Lockdown came in and picked up our regular tournaments online,
and organised them by group emails. We also set up the club on Facebook and share the tournament information there. Contact
<a href="mailto:stanyeenz@gmail.com">stanyeenz@gmail.com</a> if interested. Our website was down (update: now
<a href="https://papatoetoechessclub.org.nz/">up again</a>, so this was how we handled it.

@HWellington Chess Club
Wellington Chess Club are now running normal Swiss events online as described on the <a href="http://nzchessmag.com/wellingtonchessclub/online.html">online page</a>
of their website. They are also running new online only events, and competing in the emerging national team competition. Their early experience and approach is documented <a href="running-chess-clubs-online.html">here</a>.
<br><b>Our number one tip: </b>Please, if you are making an online account with a view to replacing your normal over-the-board chess
during the Covid-19 crisis, just use your normal name. It will make it a lot easier for your club administrators and for your opponents
Last but not least, it will even help you to readily recognise normal local chess - just online.

@HAuckland University Chess Association
Rishit Patel from AUCA has been in touch. AUCA (not yet an official NZCF club, but they're working on it), have adapted to the transition online like ducks to water.
They have held a number of events and matches (including matches with other Australasian universities), and have a growing roster of players. 
</p><p>
AUCA promote an all inclusive chess environment. They do especially encourage younger people, such as high school students and university members, or recent graduates of university to join in their events,
but also welcome regular members from other clubs to join. Sart at their Facebook page <a href="https://m.facebook.com/aucklandunichess/">(link)</a>.

@HCheck Your Local Listings
I don't propose to research what every club in the country is doing, but I do offer to put localised
information up on this page if I am asked (nicely:). In the meantime players can always check the
club websites themselves, see the <a href="chessclubs.html">Chess Clubs page</a>.
