@HSome ideas on running chess clubs online
<i>by NZCF and Wellington CC web administrator Bill Forster, 28th March 2020</i>

In this strange time over-the-board enthusiasts around the world are scrambling
to try to move traditional clubs online, temporarily at least. This short
article shares some ideas on how to get started, based on the experience so far
of the Wellington Chess Club. I expect some rapid technical innovation, but for
the moment at least it's difficult or impossible to run the same type of
competitions you usually do, with the in-person culture you're used to. But you
can still play chess with (most of) the local players and have fun. Before
discussing any of the technological specifics, it's worth thinking a little
about the bigger picture.

@HCulture
Online chess has its own culture, with super-fast time controls (at least partly
to try to make cheating with engines harder), crazy anonymous handles (instead
of real names) and all pervasive noisy chat, hopefully witty and good natured,
but sometimes unpleasant.
</p><p>
It is very important to communicate clearly to your members that you are trying
to reproduce the culture of the local club within the online club. So it is
going to be different to the online chess they might be used to. Players who
only want to play bullet chess (super fast chess) with a lot of trash talk and
general mischief have a million other options, they are already catered for
online. The older players who have often carried the burden of keeping the club
going, perhaps for decades, deserve a place where they can feel comfortable and
can play a form of chess that they are more familiar with, with people they
know. Very importantly, their needs overlap with the very young juniors who are
just starting out on chess. who have a safe place to play at the local club, and
need somewhere similar online.
</p><p>
With guidelines firmly in place, you can establish a little community within a
community where the chat is respectful and restrained. Say YES to a little good
natured banter, and NO to swearing, over-communicating, intergenerational
warfare and incessant moaning and calls for faster time controls.

@HTechnology
There are multiple competing online chess services. No doubt they all have merit
but you have to choose one, and we went with Lichess which is widely admired for
its high quality open source technology and is completely free.
</p><p>
Lichess has a "Teams" feature under "Community". Create your online club as a
team. As a general principle try to avoid clever names which can create barriers
to newcomers, we gave our club the highly imaginative name "Wellington Chess
Club". (Actually we found the name was already used, but kudos to the young
player at our club who had created this team name a year earlier and cheerfully
handed over control to the WCC committee).
</p><p>
Lichess tournaments can be restricted to members of a team. So in principle
everything is very easy, create a tournament to run at a scheduled time (eg the
normal time on a normal club night), communicate to your club members and let
them know about the initiative. Tell them how to create an account on Lichess if
they don't already have one, and explain they'll need to join the team ahead of
time to play. Set up your team so that the team leader manually approves
applications. Unfortunately the Lichess mechanism is a little coarse-grained,
only one poor soul can administer the club - but you can always rotate the task.
</p><p>
With a few hiccups (that we apologise for!), this process went smoothly for the
Wellington Club and we soon had plenty of members. Ian Sellen, the normal club
captain, selflessly volunteered to be team leader. He has the unenviable task of
choosing whether to admit players. In general it's probably a good idea to admit
players even if they are not actually members of the local club. You can always
kick them out if they misbehave! The balance you are trying to achieve is to
have enough locals involved that you retain the feel of the local club, but also
enough players in tournaments to give variety.
</p><p>
You can see our temporary online home at <a href="https://lichess.org/team/wellington-chess-club">https://lichess.org/team/wellington-chess-club</a>.
Lichess team pages include links to all the tournaments (and matches
against other online clubs!) past and present. Of course it is very important
that our normal website <a href="http://nzchessmag.com/wellingtonchessclub/">http://nzchessmag.com/wellingtonchessclub</a> has
information about the online activity, and tells people how to get involved.

@HGetting more specific
Encourage players to sign up using their real names instead of imaginative
handle names. Maybe this is just me being an old fogey, or maybe it's an
absolutely obvious common sense idea if you're trying to make something more
like a real chess club. You decide which. Unfortunately Lichess does not allow
multiple accounts, and does not allow you to change your username. If players
have a long standing Lichess account they don't want to give up, or if they just
insist on calling themself ThanosMasterOfTheUniverse or something, insist at
least that they put their actual name in their profile so you can see who they
are by clicking on their handle.
</p><p>
Rapid and Blitz (in particular) work better online than classical chess (sadly).
We started with 3+2 Blitz which is a great compromise time control because it is
actually possible to play real (if somewhat superficial) chess because there is
an increment. Just playing super-safe moves super-quickly and trying to flag
your opponent doesn't work well. (I don't know why people enjoy playing like
that either but it's endemic online). We are going to experiment with longer
time controls. We have complaints (usually from older players) that 3+2 is too
fast and complaints (exclusively from younger players :) that it's too slow. For
reasons discussed above the youngsters aren't winning this argument at the
Wellington Chess Club at least.
</p><p>
Lichess tournaments are not Swisses or Round-Robins, they're "Arenas". Instead
of a fixed number of rounds, there's a fixed amount of time. You can (and
probably will) be paired with the same player more than once. It might sound
weird to the uninitiated, but it's great fun and adapted naturally to online
play. If you don't have a lot of players you might have long-ish waits for a
pairing, but this isn't such a curse online, because Lichess makes it very easy
to watch other games in the tournament while you wait.
</p><p>
It's a good idea to encourage players who haven't played a lot online to
practise by playing in a few online tournaments (they run continually) to learn
how they work before they play in a club tournament. We didn't do that. Learn
from our mistakes!
</p><p>
Having said earlier that it is not possible to play normal tournaments online,
we are now doing exactly that! The idea is to use your normal pairing
software instead of Lichess to pair players. Players find each other and challenge each other manually
inside the Lichess ecosystem. We now describe <a href="http://nzchessmag.com/wellingtonchessclub/online.html">exactly how we do it on our website</a>.
I believe other clubs have independently discovered this model and are also operating it successfully.
</p><p>
As noted earlier, the tournament chat can be problematic, although you can tame
it by setting the right expectations and not tolerating bad behaviour. It is
possible to not show or ignore the chat and it was notable that both Anthony Ker
and Scott Wastney were doing just that on our online first club night. They were
also playing their normal beautiful chess and warming my heart by playing under
their normal names as well.
