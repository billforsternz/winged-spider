@HCovid-19
NZCF policy is now modified, see the President's Newsletter for November 5th below. No NZCF official tournaments will be conducted (nor should Open tournaments be conducted) until the Covid-19 Protection Framework
(‘traffic light system’) is formally in place and the legal definitions of ‘Red’, ‘Orange’ and ‘Green’ are available.

@HPresident’s Newsletter<br>5th November 2021
<b>1. Update on Chess under Covid Restrictions</b>
</p><p>
NZCF Council met by Zoom last Sunday 31st October. There has been extensive and ongoing
email discussion including input from external sources. After thorough discussion, the following
decision was agreed by majority:
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>
NZCF Council advises Clubs that each Club, as an independent entity, must decide for
themselves, and bear responsibility for their decision, if over-the-board Club play is safe for
their members at current Government defined ‘Level 2’. Such Club games will be eligible for
NZCF and FIDE rating. Obviously, all Government mandates must be followed regarding
registration, sanitation, social distancing, mask wearing etc.
</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Of those Councillors that did not support this decision, two have requested their names be public
<br>Ross Jackson and Stan Yee.
<br>NZCF Council is not collectively qualified to judge safety risk of Covid infection during Club play.
We do however urge a strongly precautionary approach and made the following decision
unanimously:
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>
NZCF Council recommends to Clubs that all persons present on Club premises wear masks, be
fully vaccinated and do not consume food and drink.
</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<b>Note that there is no change to Council advice that no NZCF official tournaments will be
conducted (nor should Open tournaments be conducted) until the Covid-19 Protection
Framework (‘traffic light system’) is formally in place and the legal definitions of ‘Red’,
‘Orange’ and ‘Green’ are available.</b>
</p><p>
The Government is due to make an announcement on implementation of Covid-19 Protection
Framework on 29 th November. Council will meet 30 th November and will advise chess community
how this system affects official tournaments, Congress in particular.
</p><p>
<b>2. FIDE Grant for Junior Coaching, Trainer Development, Arbiter Training</b>
</p><p>
Paul Spiller and I attended by Zoom a meeting of FIDE’s Planning &amp; Development Commission
(PDC). Following encouragement from the Chair, we put together a proposal for online
development activities in December which we are delighted to advise was approved for funding.
Hilton Bennett is our delegated Organiser and will announce details soon.
</p><p>
<b>3. Asian Chess Federation Online Tournaments and Trainers Seminar</b>
</p><p>
There has been a remarkable number of online tournaments this year, mostly for Juniors, organised
by Asian Chess Federation. These have been well attended by our Juniors in various age groups
despite the quite high entry fees. Since my last newsletter in August, our Juniors have performed
creditably in Eastern Asia Youth Chess Championship (host Thailand Chess Association) and Asian
Youth Championship (host All India Chess Federation). Daqi Mao scored a notable 7/9 in the Asian
Youth sharing 5 th place in field of 250. The Asian Amateur Championship (host: Oman Chess
Committee) will be played this month.
These tournaments create a lot of work for the Secretary of NZCF and for me, but I particularly want
to thank Timothy Ha who has indefatigably convened, supervised and problem-solved all these
events. Thanks Timothy!
Evguenia Charomova (and I as guest) participated in a FIDE Trainers Online Seminar. This was a set
of Zoom lectures over three nights lasting past midnight! We hope to get the recorded lectures
available for use by NZCF.
</p><p>
<b>4. NZ Seniors and Veterans Online Championship</b>
</p><p>
In view of Covid restrictions the formal over-the-board Championship is replaced with our first NZCF
online event. Although played at standard time control there is an element of fun in this tournament
played on a trust basis and open to international players. Thanks to Paul Spiller (Organiser), Bruce
Pollard (Arbiter) and Timothy Ha (Convenor) who made this happen!

@HPresident’s Newsletter - COVID Update<br>5th October 2021
NZCF Council met by Zoom last Sunday 3rd October. We discussed the latest Covid update and the implications for over-the-board (OTB) play.
It is obviously distressing to all of us that tournaments are being cancelled or postponed.
We cannot predict if, and when we will reach ‘Level 1’.
</p><p>
For the moment NZCF advice is unchanged – there will be no official NZCF tournaments and no games NZCF or FIDE rated at Level 2 or above.
But we are watching closely Government updates and what other associations of ‘mind sports’ like bridge are doing.
There is another Council meeting 31st Oct and I will provide a further update immediately after that.

@HNational Interschool Finals postponed until December
<i>Notice dated 7th September 2021</i>
</p><p>
The National Interschool Finals will now be held on 18th and 19th December.
</p><p>
The venue remains Alexandra Park in Auckland and all other details are the
same.
</p><p>
With Auckland still in Level Four and very unlikely to reach the required Level
One by the original dates of 2nd and 3rd October, NZCF’s Interschool Committee
and National Finals Organiser Bruce Pollard have decided that the change of
dates will give participating schools more certainty and make it easier to plan
travel and accommodation.
</p><p>
Schools now have until 1st October to confirm their entries and team lists, using
the official entry form.
</p><p>
The deadline for payment of entry fees has been extended until 1st December.
</p><p>
Thank you to all the schools which have already confirmed their entries and
paid the entry fee.
</p><p>
If the new dates change your decision please advise Bruce
<a href="mailto:bruce.pollard@ymail.com">bruce.pollard@ymail.com</a>
and me <a href="mailto:caissa1530@gmail.com">caissa1530@gmail.com</a>.
</p><p>
We look forward to another enjoyable and exciting Interschool Final.

@HNational Interschools Finals Update
<i>Notice dated 4th September 2021</i>
</p><p>
To provide some certainty about the upcoming National Interschool Finals in Auckland the
following decisions have been made.
<ul>
<li>
NZCF is currently still aiming to hold these on the 2nd and 3rd October at Alexandra
Park.
</li><li>
Qualifying schools should have confirmed their entries and submitted team lists by
1st September.
</li><li>
The deadline for payment of entry fees has been extended until 25th September
</li><li>
A decision on re-scheduling the Nationals will be made by 25th September at the
latest.
</li><li>
A definite back-up weekend of 18th and 19th December has been established, still at
Alexandra Park.
</li>
</ul>
My feeling is that Auckland is unlikely to drop to level one by 2nd October.
NZCF’s policy is that over the board chess cannot be played in level two.
Therefore schools should be aware that the National Interschool Finals will probably be
moved to the weekend of 18th and 19th December – after the school term has finished.

@HPresident’s Year-in-Review<br>28th August 2021
Greetings fellow chess players!
</p><p>
I was on a recent Zoom meeting with other Asian Chess Federations and everyone was congratulating us on being able to play OTB chess… Alas, here we are back in lockdown with cancelled tournaments! It is so unfortunate for chess - but public health comes first.
</p><p>
Your NZCF Council continues to meet monthly by Zoom with all Regional Councillors engaged. I will talk more next month about all the initiatives underway. 
</p><p>
Let’s recall some highlights of the year:
<ul>
<li>
FM Nic Croad, our NZ Champion represented NZ in the first online Oceania Zonal. He came a very creditable 3rd after two grandmasters. 
</li><li>
Timothy Ha is doing a great job maintaining our online activity. He captained several NZ teams in FIDE Cadets and Youth Rapid World Cup and right now our Online Olympiad team. 
</li><li>
Vyanla Punsalan and Emily Gan competed in the Online Asian Women's Championship performing respectably in a tough field.
</li><li>
FM Ewen Green was awarded FIDE Veteran’s Support grant (out of 27 for the world!) after persistent lobbying by Council.
</li><li>
FM Allen Fan was selected to represent NZ in FIDE World Cup for the first time NZ has been invited! Right at the last minute he could not get an MIQ place for his return so had to cancel - to the regret of us all.
</li><li>
Paul Spiller our Vice-President, and Howick-Pakuranga Club inaugurated the Bob Wade Memorial Tournament in honour of our first IM. Won by visiting GM Gawain Jones, who is married to former NZ Women’s Champion Sue Maroroa.
</li><li>
This tournament concluded with the Bob Wade Memorial Dinner in which GM Murray Chandler, our Vice-Patron and former Olympiad representative Grant Kerr, CM Bill Forster, our Wellington Regional Councillor Ross Jackson, Peter Weir and Paul Spiller shared their warm reminiscences of Bob -a great New Zealander!
</li><li>
The Regional Interschools Championships and Auckland Schoolgirls Championship had record turnouts. Literally thousands of schoolchildren are playing competitive chess with clocks all under the watchful eyes of our International, FIDE and National Arbiters. With luck our National Finals may still yet proceed.
</li><li>
NA Richie Christie of Invercargill and NA Jingbo Wei of Auckland (and I) recently attended three 5-hour Zoom sessions on FIDE Arbiters’ Manual and passed the online examination -a prerequisite to becoming FIDE Arbiter.
</li><li>
CM Bill Forster, our Webmaster and Rowan Wood, our Rating Officer and NA Michael Freeman our FIDE Delegate, have improved the visibility and access to our NZCF Rating List which runs parallel to the FIDE Rating List.
</li>
</ul>

@HApplications are Invited for the FIDE Cadets and Youth Rapid World Cup<br>3rd June 2021
This online tournament is being run from August 1st - 31st.
There are five different age groups (U10, U12, U14, U16, U18) and two sections, Open and Girls. Participants

under 10, i.e. had not yet reached their 10th birthday, at the start of this calendar year. NZCF
may select up to three participants in each group and section, so up to 3 x 5 x 2 = 30 players in
total.
</p><p>
The tournament will proceed in two stages, 10 round Swiss tournaments in the first stage (through
August 20th), then a knockout stage for a limited number of qualifying players. More details are
available on the FIDE Calendar <a href="https://www.fide.com/calendar/51523">here</a>. Prospective
players should note that the playing time is rather timezone hostile, play each day starts at 2AM NZ time.

@HA New Budget Process for NZCF Tournaments<br>7th May 2021
NZCF has changed the way it will partner with clubs to host NZCF annual events
such as the NZCF CONGRESS, NZCF Junior Championship, NZCF South Island
Championship etc.
</p><p>
As part of the expression of interest in hosting an NZCF event we are now asking
clubs to submit a draft budget for an event. The event budget will be agreed
between the host Club and NZCF and will contribute to the agreement of any
guarantee against loss available from NZCF. This will give both NZCF and the host
club certainty as to the financial outcome of hosting the event.
</p><p>
To use this process please use the NZCF tournament <a href="NZCFdocs/NZCF TOURNAMENT BUDGET TEMPLATE APRIL 2021.docx">budget template</a>. This document
can also be found in its permanent home on the <a href="resources.html">Resources page</a> in the section NZCF Application Forms.
