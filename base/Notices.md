@HNational Interschool Finals postponed until December
<i>Notice dated 7th September 2021</i>
</p><p>
The National Interschool Finals will now be held on 18th and 19th December.
</p><p>
The venue remains Alexandra Park in Auckland and all other details are the
same.
</p><p>
With Auckland still in Level Four and very unlikely to reach the required Level
One by the original dates of 2nd and 3rd October, NZCF’s Interschool Committee
and National Finals Organiser Bruce Pollard have decided that the change of
dates will give participating schools more certainty and make it easier to plan
travel and accommodation.
</p><p>
Schools now have until 1st October to confirm their entries and team lists, using
the official entry form.
</p><p>
The deadline for payment of entry fees has been extended until 1st December.
</p><p>
Thank you to all the schools which have already confirmed their entries and
paid the entry fee.
</p><p>
If the new dates change your decision please advise Bruce
<a href="mailto:bruce.pollard@ymail.com">bruce.pollard@ymail.com</a>
and me <a href="mailto:caissa1530@gmail.com">caissa1530@gmail.com</a>.
</p><p>
We look forward to another enjoyable and exciting Interschool Final.
</p><p>

@HNational Interschools Finals Update
<i>Notice dated 4th September 2021</i>
</p><p>
To provide some certainty about the upcoming National Interschool Finals in Auckland the
following decisions have been made.
<ul>
<li>
NZCF is currently still aiming to hold these on the 2nd and 3rd October at Alexandra
Park.
</li><li>
Qualifying schools should have confirmed their entries and submitted team lists by
1st September.
</li><li>
The deadline for payment of entry fees has been extended until 25th September
</li><li>
A decision on re-scheduling the Nationals will be made by 25th September at the
latest.
</li><li>
A definite back-up weekend of 18th and 19th December has been established, still at
Alexandra Park.
</li>
</ul>
My feeling is that Auckland is unlikely to drop to level one by 2nd October.
NZCF’s policy is that over the board chess cannot be played in level two.
Therefore schools should be aware that the National Interschool Finals will probably be
moved to the weekend of 18th and 19th December – after the school term has finished.

@HPresident’s Year-in-Review<br>28th August 2021
Greetings fellow chess players!
</p><p>
I was on a recent Zoom meeting with other Asian Chess Federations and everyone was congratulating us on being able to play OTB chess… Alas, here we are back in lockdown with cancelled tournaments! It is so unfortunate for chess - but public health comes first.
</p><p>
Your NZCF Council continues to meet monthly by Zoom with all Regional Councillors engaged. I will talk more next month about all the initiatives underway. 
</p><p>
Let’s recall some highlights of the year:
<ul>
<li>
FM Nic Croad, our NZ Champion represented NZ in the first online Oceania Zonal. He came a very creditable 3rd after two grandmasters. 
</li><li>
Timothy Ha is doing a great job maintaining our online activity. He captained several NZ teams in FIDE Cadets and Youth Rapid World Cup and right now our Online Olympiad team. 
</li><li>
Vyanla Punsalan and Emily Gan competed in the Online Asian Women's Championship performing respectably in a tough field.
</li><li>
FM Ewen Green was awarded FIDE Veteran’s Support grant (out of 27 for the world!) after persistent lobbying by Council.
</li><li>
FM Allen Fan was selected to represent NZ in FIDE World Cup for the first time NZ has been invited! Right at the last minute he could not get an MIQ place for his return so had to cancel - to the regret of us all.
</li><li>
Paul Spiller our Vice-President, and Howick-Pakuranga Club inaugurated the Bob Wade Memorial Tournament in honour of our first IM. Won by visiting GM Gawain Jones, who is married to former NZ Women’s Champion Sue Maroroa.
</li><li>
This tournament concluded with the Bob Wade Memorial Dinner in which GM Murray Chandler, our Vice-Patron and former Olympiad representative Grant Kerr, CM Bill Forster, our Wellington Regional Councillor Ross Jackson, Peter Weir and Paul Spiller shared their warm reminiscences of Bob -a great New Zealander!
</li><li>
The Regional Interschools Championships and Auckland Schoolgirls Championship had record turnouts. Literally thousands of schoolchildren are playing competitive chess with clocks all under the watchful eyes of our International, FIDE and National Arbiters. With luck our National Finals may still yet proceed.
</li><li>
NA Richie Christie of Invercargill and NA Jingbo Wei of Auckland (and I) recently attended three 5-hour Zoom sessions on FIDE Arbiters’ Manual and passed the online examination -a prerequisite to becoming FIDE Arbiter.
</li><li>
CM Bill Forster, our Webmaster and Rowan Wood, our Rating Officer and NA Michael Freeman our FIDE Delegate, have improved the visibility and access to our NZCF Rating List which runs parallel to the FIDE Rating List.
</li>
</ul>

@HApplications are Invited for the FIDE Cadets and Youth Rapid World Cup<br>3rd June 2021
This online tournament is being run from August 1st - 31st.
There are five different age groups (U10, U12, U14, U16, U18) and two sections, Open and Girls. Participants
must have been age qualified on January 1st 2021. So for example U10 participants must have been
under 10, i.e. had not yet reached their 10th birthday, at the start of this calendar year. NZCF
may select up to three participants in each group and section, so up to 3 x 5 x 2 = 30 players in
total.
</p><p>
The tournament will proceed in two stages, 10 round Swiss tournaments in the first stage (through
August 20th), then a knockout stage for a limited number of qualifying players. More details are
available on the FIDE Calendar <a href="https://www.fide.com/calendar/51523">here</a>. Prospective
players should note that the playing time is rather timezone hostile, play each day starts at 2AM NZ time.
</p><p>

@HA New Budget Process for NZCF Tournaments<br>7th May 2021
NZCF has changed the way it will partner with clubs to host NZCF annual events
such as the NZCF CONGRESS, NZCF Junior Championship, NZCF South Island
Championship etc.
</p><p>
As part of the expression of interest in hosting an NZCF event we are now asking
clubs to submit a draft budget for an event. The event budget will be agreed
between the host Club and NZCF and will contribute to the agreement of any
guarantee against loss available from NZCF. This will give both NZCF and the host
club certainty as to the financial outcome of hosting the event.
</p><p>
To use this process please use the NZCF tournament <a href="NZCFdocs/NZCF TOURNAMENT BUDGET TEMPLATE APRIL 2021.docx">budget template</a>. This document
can also be found in its permanent home on the <a href="resources.html">Resources page</a> in the section NZCF Application Forms.
