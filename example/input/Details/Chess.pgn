Winged Spider was developed to maintain the New Zealand Chess Federation
website, and it makes sense for it to have a special chess feature built in.
Basically I have copied and pasted it from the nascent 'Publish' feature
included in my Tarrasch Chess GUI. I made interactive Magazine, Listener
and Bulletin pages on the NZCF site with Tarrasch for several years, but
it involved repetitious labour in a GUI and it was a great relief to
automate it with Winged Spider.

Basically all you need to do if you want to use this feature is put .pgn
files alongside markdown files. It's also possible to use a text editor
to add markdown format text like this between the games. Make sure you
leave a blank line between the text and the chess content and very
importantly, see also the note at the bottom of the page.

The rendered pages themselves I quite like, preferring the 'chess book'
style presentation to the more normal one big diagram presentation. It
can be a little slow if you don't have a fast connection to the server,
hopefully I'll have a chance to improve it at some time (the underlying
technology is unchanged for years).

One important technical point, on the NZCF website I use publishv1.04.js
which is exactly the same as publishv1.03.js used in this example *except*
that 1.04 assumes there are two images in the header and 1.03 assumes there
are none. Relying on exactly zero, or two or any other number of extra images
is a truly sad limitation I hope to eliminate at some stage, hopefully sooner
rather than later. The only place you can safely add images to chess pages
like this is after all the chess.

In my chess writing I am normally (and justifiably) very self deprecating
but for my example here I thought I would take the opportunity to show I
can play a bit, this is perhaps my favourite game, from New Zealand's
biggest weekender, in 2007.

sufficient for a turnaround. This is not the best square and Black has a lot of
fun for the rest of the game. Both White's proud extra centre pawns look
securely defended but Black gives up both knights for them to tear the position

to be accused of premature resignation. For anxious players like me in such
circumstances it's a good idea to permanently prevent any possible queen plus
knight shenanigans. A knight hates rook pawns, and here it faces three of them!
Even so as a nervous finisher I wanted to give up my rook for the knight and
eliminate the possibility of forks as well, but White never gave me a chance.}

If you have text like this after the last game, unfortunately you also need to add
a dummy game to go with it. This is a quirk of the Tarrasch publishing code
which processes all text between games strictly as a *prefix* to a game. So I need a game
for which this text is prefix. It's not a serious problem just make a
Dummy game at the very end of the file which looks like
this. <br><pre>&#x23;SkipGame<br><br>[White &quot;Dummy&quot;]<br>[Black &quot;Dummy&quot;]<br>[Result &quot;&#x2a;&quot;]<br><br>&#x2a;<br></pre>

With the dummy game in place, the prefix to the dummy game will be rendered as
html, but the dummy game won't be.
