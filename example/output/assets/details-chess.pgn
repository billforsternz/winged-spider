opening has been a catastrophe and Black is quite lost, but he does have a lead
in development...} 12... Nc6 13. Qg3 $2 {Diagram #Just one mistake is
sufficient for a turnaround. This is not the best square and Black has a lot of
fun for the rest of the game. Both White's proud extra centre pawns look
securely defended but Black gives up both knights for them to tear the position
open.} 13... Nxd4 $1 14. cxd4 Qxd4 15. Ra2 Qc4 {Fork!} 16. Ne2 Qxa2 17. Qxc7 $2

try to grovel an exchange down} ) 17... Rac8 18. Qxb7 {Diagram #} 18... Nxe4 $1

Qxa3 28. e5 Qa6 29. Kd2 Qh6+ $1 {A nice practical decision. White does not want
to be accused of premature resignation. For anxious players like me in such
circumstances it's a good idea to permanently prevent any possible queen plus
knight shenanigans. A knight hates rook pawns, and here it faces three of them!
Even so as a nervous finisher I wanted to give up my rook for the knight and
eliminate the possibility of forks as well, but White never gave me a chance.}
