Early stage .pgn rendering involved creating a simple .pgn page in a bogus location (History folder)

Trusts Best Games.md was created by Tarrasch in July (using a different name)
2021-trusts-goal.html was how poole rendered it in July ('goal' because we want Winged Spider to do something similar)
2021-trusts-start.html was how winged-spider first rendered it
2021-trusts-migrate.html is work in progress, migrating from start to goal with manual tweaks
2021-trusts-snapshot.html is a copy of a successful 2021-trusts-migrate.html

Some important things that made snapshot successful
- line-height is 0 on a/the diagram css class
- style4.css is reduced to only the chess styles
- need to get rid of the 2 graphics in header for now (this will change in the future!)
