Starting out again on an attempt to get on top of NZCF site generation issues

Some thoughts:
Find all the disparate parts that come together to create the whole site first
So - make a site map see peer file sitemap.txt
Have a look at the different build*.bat files in poole/nzcf-archives, there are clues there
The name nzcf-archives is significant - I think it is all about the Archives section of the menu
Remember we want to take the PGN -> MD processor from Tarrasch and put it in WingedSpider
There are multiple Keong tournaments where we haven't got a crosstable
Remember that time when a google search yielded a result in the Vega/2017/ or similar directory?
While poole/nzcf-archives is where we build the site, poole/nzcf is where we build Listener and NZ Chess bulletin playthroughs

Some questions:
I think the name nzcf-archives comes from the Archives section of the menu, and poole is needed
to do some basic (very basic) markdown processing. Details please?
Did we make a start in github/WingedSpider already?
  A: That looks like an attempt to pick up photos.exe

Inlined below is the file C:\Users\Bill\Documents\poole\nzcf-archive\input\roadmap.txt another attempt

How does this website come together?

Combination of hand edited HTML plus poole\nzcf (interactive magazine) plus pool\nzcf-archives (start of content management system)

1) In directory pool\nzcf-archives, uses new simple CMS currently frozen in \users\bill\documents\github\photos\release\photos.exe, builds
an HTML file from a .md like .txt file plus a template file input\template-main.txt. File build2.bat builds all 10 pages, eg;
\users\bill\documents\github\photos\release\photos.exe input\fresh-index.txt input\template-main.txt \users\bill\documents\newzealandchess.co.nz\index.html

1A) Same as 1) except use input\template-grandprix.txt

2) Old NZCF style html page

3) External URL

4) Handcrafted, and served as model for 1) I believe

5) Kind of like 4) perhaps ? Maybe try to make this more like 1)

Some more notes about 5)
File build-dot-bat-renamed-to-avoid-accidentally-doing-it.bat remains as documentation on how all this was stitched together.
One important technique is the @W macro in the content management system. It means 'write out whole file'. Basically we often
use poole to convert .md or at least text that's sufficiently close to .md to .html, then use the CMS to add the header and
menu to that html, using the @W feature. This is how we do both Archives - Results Poison Pawn years (2001-2008) and
Archives - Tournaments.
